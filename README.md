# Salesforce Platform Events & Change Data Capture Playground 

Salesforceâ€™s eventing capabilities are well understood for event-based integration and traditional pub-sub event bus scenarios but its utilization in application architecture within the platform is misunderstood at worst and scarcely used at best.

In order to generate awareness and interest in Salesforce more modern event-driven capabilities, and ideally do the dual duty of driving both adoption and incremental Platform Event ACV, I've  built out a number of working code examples that showcase Platform Events and its interoperability with existing platform capabilities to build event-driven applications and facilitate event-drive automation with the Salesforce platform.
